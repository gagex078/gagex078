<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>My name is Greta, I'm a 5th year senior at the University of Minnesota studying Technical Writing and Communications. Additionally, I'm pursuing minors in French and Mass Communications. During my free time I work at the Vera Bradley store in the Mall of America, watch too much HGTV, play video games, go to concerts, and spend more time than needed on the internet.</p>


<h2>What This Repo is For</h2>

<p>I'll be using this repository to organize my work for WRIT 4662W at the University of Minnesota.</p>


<h2>Shrimp! Heaven! Now!</h2>
